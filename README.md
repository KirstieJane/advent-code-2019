*Exercises for the 2019 Advent of Code*

Here's the link to this year's Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2019.
It's created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and consists of 50 puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.

My main goal with these exercises is to feel confident writing tests and having them run via continuous integration.
So the solutions are probably overengineered, but they're really valuable learning tools for me ðŸ’–

You can run each of my solutions via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KirstieJane/advent-code-2019/master?urlpath=lab).

You should be able to test all the code in the terminal by typing:

```
python -m pytest --cov -v
```

And you can run all the code by typing:

```
for puz in `ls -d day??/day??_puz?.py`; do python ${puz}; done
```
