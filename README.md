*Exercises for the 2019 Advent of Code*

You can run each of the exercises via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KirstieJane/advent-code-2019/master?filepath=lab).

My main goal with these exercises is to feel confident writing tests and having them run via continuous integration.
So the solutions are probably overengineered, but they're really valuable learning tools for me ðŸ’–
